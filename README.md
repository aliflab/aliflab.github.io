### Custom Scripts (`assets/myjs/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `theme-toggle.js` | Light / dark mode toggle - syncs icon, applies `dark-mode` class, persists to `localStorage` |
| `hero-typer.js` | Typing animation for role titles in the hero section |
| `hero-stats.js` | Count-up animation for the fun stats widget (IntersectionObserver) |
| `projects.js` | Project grid filtering and show more / less logic |
| `genai.js` | Renders the AI stack pyramid and tool modals from a data array |
| `submitform.js` | Intercepts `#contactForm` submit, POSTs to Formspree via `fetch` |
| `constant.js` | Defines `HOME_PAGE_URL` constant |
| `pkey.js` | Password prompt on protected pages; redirects on wrong password |

---

## Development

No install step required. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or use any static file server for live reloading:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
# or
npx serve .
```

There are no linting, test, or build commands.

---

## Deployment

Push to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages serves the site automatically from the repository root.

---

## Dark Mode

A sun/moon toggle button is fixed in the top-right corner. Clicking it adds/removes the `dark-mode` class on `<body>` and saves the preference to `localStorage` so it persists across visits.

Implementation notes:
- An inline `<script>` immediately after the `<body>` tag restores the saved class before any paint, preventing a flash of the wrong theme.
- All dark mode overrides live at the bottom of `styles.css` under the `/* DARK MODE */` comment block, scoped to `body.dark-mode`.
- The existing `white-vertion` class stays on `<body>` at all times; dark mode rules use higher specificity (`body.dark-mode.white-vertion`) to override the light theme defaults.

---

## Asset Path Convention

- `index.html` (root) - uses `assets/...`
- Files inside `blog/` - use `../assets/...`
- `constant.js` must be loaded before `pkey.js` on blog/protected pages
